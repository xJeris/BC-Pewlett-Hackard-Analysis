# Analysis of Retirement Age Employees

### Overview
This analysis identifies how many employees are of retirement age and which employees are eligible for a mentorship program. Retirement age is defined as anyone born between 1952 and 1955. Eligibility for the mentorship program is limited to those employees born in 1965. The goal is to help prepare the company to be able to refill those positions.

### Results
The results of this analysis show that the "silver tsunami" of retirements will have a significant impact on the company, as more than 70,000 employees are expected to leave. This issue is compounded by the mentorship program not having enough eligible participants to help train and re-fill those positions.

* There are a total of 72,458 people eligible to retire.
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

### Summary
In order for the company to successfully mitigate the large number of retirements, I would recommend they expand the eligibility requirements for their mentorship program. By including employees born in 1964, they would expand the eligible number from 1,549 to 19,905. If it was expanded by 2 years, to 1963, that would bring the total to 38,401.

##### Impacted Roles
There are 7 roles that will be impacted by the expected retirements. The largest impact will be to the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff roles.<br/><br/>

##### Mentorship
The employees currently eligible for the mentorship program will not be enough to mentor the needed number of replacement employees. As an example, each of the Senior Engineer mentors would need to mentor more than 153 employees over the next 10 years to fill all of the retirements. This doesn't account for any additional retirements in that time period.<br/><br/>
